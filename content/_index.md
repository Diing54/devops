# My Kasten

Hello! I’m Diing, a Computer Science graduate currently striving for true mastery of Cloud Native Systems. This is a place I call My Kasten, a word derived from German language meaning a box, crate or container. From the word "Kasten" this is digital space that will act as the storage of my notes that I am creating and constantly updating while I'm learning DevOps, linux, networking, docker, kubernetes etc.
