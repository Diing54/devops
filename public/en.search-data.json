{"/docs/bash-scripting/":{"data":{"":"Date: 2026-01-23 Intro A bash script is a file containing lines of code either simple commands or complex ones tha can either navigate directories or create other stuff; in simple words they can do a series of actions. Basically they can run bash commands eg ls , mkdir, ps, grep ,touch ,rm etc. A bash script can be executed and the lines of code inside it will be run line by line. Advantages of bash scripting Automation - Shell scripts allow a user to automate repetitive tasks hence saving on time and minimizing the risk of human error Portability - Can run on various OS including windows through VM’s HIghly flexible as they can be customized easily Easy to write as they require any special software Integration - Shell scripts can be integrated with other tools and applications and cloud services allowing for more complex automation and system management tasks Debugging - They are easy to debug and most of them have built-in debugging and error-reporting tools NOTE : Shell is a program responsible for displaying of an interface for interacting the OS(CLI- Command Line Interface). Bash is a type of shell. Creating and executing bash scripts Bash scripts end with .sh A bash script starts with a shebang. This is the first line which must be present in a script which specifies the interpreter that will be used when executing the script. This allows users to leverage the power of different interpreters. Shebang tells the shell to execute it via bash shell When saving a script file, its is good practice to place commonly used scripts in the ~/bin/ directory The script files also need to have the execute permission to allow them to run An example of a shebang statement (#!/bin/bash) The read command reads the input and stores it in the variable path The ls -al command takes the variable with the stored path and displays the details of the path We can then run the script using the following commands : sh hello.sh bash hello.sh - These commands(sh hello.sh) must be specified with the directory of the bash script if not in the bash script directory ./hello.sh - ./ tells the bash to execute hello.sh in the current working directory. We can use hello.sh to execute the bash script while on any directory of the terminal if the path of the script file is added to the $PATH variable . hello.sh When a script is executed using either the bash command or the dot (.) command, you do not have to set executable permissions on script but read permissions need to be set. Variables and data types Variables store data which can be read, accessed and manipulated eg : name=John We can also set a variable to a path of a particular directory as shown below path=/etc $ is required to access the variable’s content The naming conventions of a variable are : Variable names should start with a letter or an underscore (_). Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_). Variable names are case-sensitive. Variable names should not contain spaces or special characters. Command line Arguments Command line arguments allow users to pass data to a bash script at runtime, These arguments are accessible inside the script using special variables.\nThe command line arguments are stored in special variables:\n$0 = The name of the script $1, $2, $3, ……. = First, second, third argument respectively etc $# - Total number of arguments passed to the bash script $@ - All the arguments supplied to the bash script $ $ - The process ID of the current script $USER - The username of the user running the script $HOSTNAME - The hostname of the machine the script is running on. Example showcasing command line arguments:\nQuotes We use quotes to enclose the values being assigned to a variable if we are working with complex values or values with spaces between. If we dont use quotes eg var=Hello World, there will be an error because by default, bash uses space for separate items.\nCommands work in the same way in the command line as they work in a script so we can just work in the command line for easier demonstration.\nWe enclose content in quotes so bash can consider it as a single item. We can use single quotes or double quotes\nSingle quotes will treat every character literally while double quotes may allow us to include other variables as part of the value as shown below :\nCommand Substitution This allows us to take the output of a command or program and save it as a value of a variable Exporting Variables When you run a shell script e.g. bash hello.sh, it starts a new process that is separate from the shell you are currently in. Its like opening a new mini terminal behind the scenes to run that script. Each process in Linux has its own memory - and variables live in memory - so a variable in your current shell won’t automatically be visible to that new process. “Variables are limited to the process they were created in”.

Nowadays , disks with 4k byte sectors are being manufactured for fast performance as compared to the old 512 bytes In the past, computers described hard drives using Cylinders, Heads, and Sectors (CHS). Modern systems use Logical Block Addressing (LBA), where every sector gets a number. For huge hard drives, an advanced version called LBA48 was introduced to handle more sectors.

CD-ROM - /media/cdrom USB drive - /mnt/usb NOTE - Suppose i wish to mount the CD-ROM which is located at /dev/sr0 to the mount point or folder /media/cdrom I need to be careful and understand that the files and subdirectories on CD-ROM will fall under /media/cdrom and any files that were originally at /media/cdrom will not be visible although they are present. When i unmount the CD-ROM the original files at /media/cdrom will become visible again. sudo mount /dev/sr0 /media/cdrom - command for mounting (This is crucial only for servers and crucial operations)"},"title":"disk-partitioning"},"/docs/linux-boot-process/":{"data":{"":"Date: 2026-01-23","1-biosuefi-initialization#1.

An example : 192.168.1.10/24 The IP is 192.168.1.10 while the mask is /24 or 255.255.255.0 The mask /24 means that the first 24 bits (the first 3 numbers) belong to the network ID; 192.168.1. This means that only devices that have their IP addresses starting with 192.168.1 can talk directly with each other. The remaining .10 belong to the host ID. This is the host device. If a raspberry Pi is 192.168.1.50, it has the same network ID and it can communicate directly. On the other hand, if a server is 192.168.2.50, it has a different network ID and a router(Gateway) is needed for communication.

This allows you to authenticate with SSH servers once and then use that authentication for multiple connections without needing to re-enter your key’s passphrase OpenSSH supports different types of authentication;\nPassword authentication - Uses your LInux login and password to authenticate. Simplest but vulnerable when your SSH session is infected with a keylogger which can capture your credentials.\nPublic key authentication - This authenticates with your personal SSH public keys. You need to create and distribute your public keys and you can login only from machines that hold your private key\nPassphrase-less authentication - Public key authentication without a passphrase. Useful for automated services like scripts and cron jobs\nThere are two different uses for authentication keys: host keys, which authenticate computers, and public keys, which authenticate users. SSH keys come in pairs, private and public. Transmissions are encrypted with the public key and decrypted with the private key, a brilliantly simple scheme. You can safely distribute your public keys as much as you want, while you must protect your private key and not let anyone else have it.\nServer and client are defined by the direction of the transaction. The server has the SSH daemon running and listening for connection requests, and the client is anyone logging in to this machine via SSH.\nsudo ssh-keygen -A\nssh-keygen: generating new host keys: RSA DSA ECDSA ED25519\nserver’s private host keys are owned by root, read-only\npublic keys, which are owned by root, read-write for root, and read-only for everyone else\nNow take a look at /etc/ssh/sshd_config. When you change this file(Uncomment the options you want to use or change.), reload sshd to load your changes:\n$ sudo systemctl reload sshd.server Any port scanner will find your open ports, and attackers will attempt brute force password cracking. Attackers still target the default SSH port 22 the most. Changing the port won’t reduce this risk very much, but it should reduce the number of entries in your log files. When you use alternate port numbers, first look in /etc/services to find unused ports, and then record the ports you use in this file.\nPublic key authentication is very strong and cannot be brute-forced like password logins (see Recipe 12.7). The trade-off is less convenience, as you can log in only from machines that have your private key.","references#References":""},"title":"openssh"},"/docs/shell-commands/":{"data":{"":"Date: 2026-01-23","alias#alias":"This is like creating a new command to mimic an existing command so that you dont use the existing command according to your preferences (alias ll = ’ls -al’) - Creating a new command ’ll’ that is an alias to ’ls -al’ (alias) - will list all the aliases defined The alias will work until the terminal sessions is closed To make it permanent, add it to the shell configuration","cat#cat":"This command is used to show the contents of a file eg\ncat /etc/systemd/network.sh","cd#cd":"The change directory command makes it possible for you to move inside a specified path/folder. by using cd .. ,you move to the previous directory/parent folder.","chmod#chmod":"Used to change the permissions of a file Every file has 3 permissions (read, write and execute) For example if a go into a directory and run ls -al, the following is displayed :\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 astro astro 4096 Feb 9 11:33 .\ndrwxr-x— 31 astro astro 4096 Feb 12 14:50 ..\ndrwxrwxr-x 8 astro astro 4096 Feb 13 12:32 .git\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 astro astro 4096 Feb 13 12:39 linux-basics\n-rw-rw-r– 1 astro astro 163 Feb 9 11:32 README.md The letters and hyphens you see at the start of every file/folder are the permissions given of the file/folder (-) means its a normal file (d) means its a directory (l) means its a link After that, the first 3 values eg rwx represents the permissions of the owner of the file/directory The next 3 values eg r-x represents the permissions of the group of the file The last 3 values eg — represents the permissions of the other members or everyone else that comes across the file rwx means that person has read, write and execute permissions of the file/directory If either of the rwx values is swapped with - ,that means that person lacks the swapped permission eg : r-x means the person has read and execute permission but lacks the write permission You can change the permissions using the chmod command Changing permissions using numeric notation discussed below :\nEach Permission has a numeric value :\nr = 4\nw = 2\nx = 1 chmod 755 file.txt - This command sets the owner : rwx (7), Group r-x (5) and others r-x (5) Changing the permissions using symbolic notation as shown below :\nu = Owner\ng = Group\no = Others chmod u+w file.txt - This adds the write permission to the Owner chmod g-x file.txt - This removes the execute permission from the group chmod o+r file.txt - This adds the read permission for others","chown#chown":"Every file/directory in linux has an owner This command is used to change the owner of the file or directory The owner of a directory/ file or the root user are eligible to use this command sudo chown astro test.txt - Transferring the file ownership to astro chown -R - Changing the ownership of a directory and all other files in it. chown : - Through this command,I can simulataneousy change the owner and the group of the file chgrp - Directly changing the group of the file","clear#clear":"Used to clear all the previous commands that were run in the current terminal The screen will clear","cp#cp":"Used to copy a file To copy folders, you need to add the -r to recursively copy the whole folder contents (cp -r fruits people)","crontab#crontab":"Cron jobs are jobs that are scheduled to run at specific intervals.

Think of it as the conductor for the system’s startup and ongoing operations, ensuring that everything runs smoothly. In older times, there was the System V initialization system (SysV init) which was popular for launching processes at startup. systemd attempts to decrease boot times and parcel out system resources more efficiently by starting processes concurrently and in parallel, and starting only necessary services, leaving other services to start after boot as needed.","pid-1---mother-of-all-processes#PID 1 - Mother of all Processes":"PID 1 is the mother of all processes on Linux systems. This is the first process to start then it launches all other processes. Processes are one or more running instances of a program.\nProcesses can create independent copies of themselves which are the child processes and the original the parent process. Each child has its own PID and its own allocation of system resources.\nThreads are lightweight processes that run in parallel and share system resources with their parents.\nSome processes run in the background and do not directly interact with the users, these are processes are ; services or daemons and their names tend to end with letter d such as httpd, sshd and systemd.\nps command to list all running processes in PID order\nThe pstree command organizes this mass of information into a tree diagram showing all processes, their child processes, PIDs, and threads, which are enclosed in curly braces.\nProcesses always exist in one of several states, and these states change according to system activity. • R is either currently running or waiting in the run queue. • l means the process is multithreaded. • S is interruptable sleep; the process is waiting for an event to complete. • s is a session leader. Sessions are related processes managed as a unit. • I is an idle kernel thread. • \u003c means high priority. • N is low priority.\nsystemctl is used to list services and their states ; We are interested in service files because Linux users and administrators interact mainly with service files and rarely need to bother with any other type of unit file.\nTo check the service files, we use the command ;\nsystemctl list-unit-files –type=service\nThe four most common states that a service can be in: enabled, disabled, static, or masked.\nList only enabled services: $ systemctl list-unit-files –type=service –state=enabled\nenabled - This shows that the service has become available and is managed by systemd.\nWhen a service is enabled, systemd creates a symlink in /etc/systemd/system/ from the unit file in /lib/systemd/system/. It can be started, stopped, reloaded, and disabled by the user with the systemctl command. Enabling a service does not immediately start it, and disabling a service does not immediately stop it.\ndisabled - Disabled means that there is no symlink in /etc/systemd/system/, and it will not start automatically at boot. You can stop and start it manually.\nmasked - This means the service is linked to /dev/null/. It is completely disabled and cannot be started by any means.\nstatic - This means that the unit file is a dependency of other unit files, and cannot be started or stopped by the user.\nsystemctl status bluetooth.service - used for querying the status of selected services\nStart a service: $ sudo systemctl start sshd.service\nStop a service: $ sudo systemctl stop sshd.service\nStop and then restart a service: $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service\nReload the service’s configuration. For example, you made a change to sshd_config and want to load the new configuration without restarting the service: $ sudo systemctl reload sshd.service\nEnabling a service configures it to automatically start at boot.e.g sudo systemctl enable sshd.service\nStopping troublesome processes can also be done by killing them; $ sudo systemctl kill mariadb ,$ systemctl status mariadb ● mariadb.service - MariaDB 10.1.44 database server\nLoaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: inactive (dead) since Sun 2020-06-28 19:57:49 PDT; 6s ago\nThe service has cleanly stopped.
