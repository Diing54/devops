  <meta name="description" content="Date: 2026-01-23 Intro When you type a command in the terminal, your system looks for the executable file in the directories listed in the $PATH variable. If a directory isn’t in $PATH, you must specify the full path to run a script.
Use any of the following options to get more information about linux commands:
man commandName info commandName commandName -h commandName –help env This command will show special variables ls This command is used when listing all the files that are inside a container. It has several combinations such as -al which returns more detailed information about the files inside a particular folder. lsblk This command will show the disks and their partitions info of your pc cat This command is used to show the contents of a file eg
cat /etc/systemd/network.sh cd The change directory command makes it possible for you to move inside a specified path/folder. by using cd .. ,you move to the previous directory/parent folder. pwd This command is used to know which directory you are in, by running it ,it will print the current folder path mkdir This command is used to create folders YOu can create multiple folders with one command: mkdir dogs people You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the -p option: mkdir -p fruits/apples rmdir Used to delete a folder or multiple folders at once ( The folder must be empty) To delete folders with files in them (rm -rf fruits people) mv Used to move a file by specifying the file’s current path and its new path (mv pear new_pear) - Renaming files and folders If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter is going to be moved into the folder (mv pear apple fruits) - pear and apple moved to the fruits folder cp Used to copy a file To copy folders, you need to add the -r to recursively copy the whole folder contents (cp -r fruits people) touch Used to create an empty file eg touch apple open Used to open a directory (open .) - opens the current directory Can also be used to open an application find The find command can be used to find files or folders matching a particular search pattern. It searches recursively (find . -name ‘*.js’) - Find all files under the current tree that have the .js extension and print the relative path of each file that matches (find . -type d name src) - Find directories under the current tree matching the name ‘src’ (find folder 1 folder 2 -name filename.txt) - Searching under multiple root trees (find . -type d -name node_modules -or -name public) - Find directories under the current tree matching the name ’node_modules’ or ‘public’ (find . -type d -name ‘.md’ -not -path ’node_modules/’) - excluding a path (find . -type f -size &#43;100c) - Searching files that have more than 100 characters(bytes) in them (find . -type f -size &#43;100k -size -1M) - Searching files bigger tha 100KB but smaller than 1MB (find . -type f -mtime &#43;3) - Searching files edited more that 3 days ago (find . -type f -mtime -1) - Searching files edited in the last 24 hrs ln Used to create links(Pointer to another file) There are two types of links(hard links and soft links Hard links are rarely used. You cant link to directories and external filesystems (ln recipes.txt newrecipes.txt) - Creating a hard link Soft links are different. They are more powerful as you can link to other filesystems and to directories but when the original is removed, the link will be broken (ln -s recipes.txt newrecipes.txt) - Creating a soft link gzip Used for compressing a file (gzip filename) - This will compress the file and append the .gz extension to it and the original file is deleted. To prevent this, use the -c option and use the output redirection to write the output to the filename.gz file. ( gzip -c filename &gt; filename.gz) (gzip -d filename.gz) - Decompressing the file gunzip Basically the equivalent of gzip only that when decompressing, no need for adding the -d tar Used to create an archive, grouping multiple files in a single file (tar -cf archive.tar file1 file2) - Creates an archive named archive.tar with the content of file1 file2 (tar -xf archive.tar) - Extract files from an archive in the current folder alias This is like creating a new command to mimic an existing command so that you dont use the existing command according to your preferences (alias ll = ’ls -al’) - Creating a new command ’ll’ that is an alias to ’ls -al’ (alias) - will list all the aliases defined The alias will work until the terminal sessions is closed To make it permanent, add it to the shell configuration tail Opens the file at the end and watches for file changes Great for watching log files ( tail -f /var/log/system.log ) grep Used to search in lines or can be combined with pipes to filter the output of another command (grep “error” logfile.txt) - Finds and prints all lines in logfile.txt containing the word “error” (grep “hello” file1.txt file2.txt) - Searches for “hello” in both files You can use -i to ignore case sensitivity (grep -i “error” logfile.txt) - Finds “Error”, “error” ,etc Can also be used in searching in the output of another command as shown in the next line ps aux | grep “firefox” (grep -v “error” logfile.txt) - Inverting the search ie exclude all lines that contain the pattern (grep -n “command” logfile.txt) - Shows the line numbers where “command” has appeared (grep -c “error” logfile.txt) - counts the number of lines containing “error” (grep “^hello” file.txt) - search for lines that start with “hello” (grep “done$” file.txt) - search for files that end with “done” sort Used in sorting elements in a file (sort -r filename.txt) - Reverses the order of sorting Can work with pipes,i.e you can use it on the output of another command ls | sort echo echo “Hello world” - prints a simple messsage name=“John”, echo “Hello $name” - This will print the value of variable echo “Hello, file” &gt; output.txt - This will direct the output to a file but will override the contents of that file echo “Hello file” » output.txt - This will append or add another line at the end of output.txt echo “Today is $(date) - Using echo with other commands chown Every file/directory in linux has an owner This command is used to change the owner of the file or directory The owner of a directory/ file or the root user are eligible to use this command sudo chown astro test.txt - Transferring the file ownership to astro chown -R - Changing the ownership of a directory and all other files in it. chown : - Through this command,I can simulataneousy change the owner and the group of the file chgrp - Directly changing the group of the file chmod Used to change the permissions of a file Every file has 3 permissions (read, write and execute) For example if a go into a directory and run ls -al, the following is displayed :

lsblk
    
This command will show the disks and their partitions info of your pc

cat
This command is used to show the contents of a file eg
cat /etc/systemd/network.sh

cd
    
The change directory command makes it possible for you to move inside a specified path/folder.
by using cd .. ,you move to the previous directory/parent folder.

pwd
    
This command is used to know which directory you are in, by running it ,it will print the current folder path

mkdir
    
This command is used to create folders
YOu can create multiple folders with one command: mkdir dogs people
You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the -p option: mkdir -p fruits/apples

rmdir
    
Used to delete a folder or multiple folders at once ( The folder must be empty)
To delete folders with files in them (rm -rf fruits people)

mv
    
Used to move a file by specifying the file&rsquo;s current path and its new path
(mv pear new_pear) - Renaming files and folders
If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter is going to be moved into the folder
(mv pear apple fruits) - pear and apple moved to the fruits folder

cp
    
Used to copy a file
To copy folders, you need to add the -r to recursively copy the whole folder contents (cp -r fruits people)

touch
    
Used to create an empty file eg touch apple

open
    
Used to open a directory
(open .) - opens the current directory
Can also be used to open an application

find
    
The find command can be used to find files or folders matching a particular search pattern. It searches recursively
(find . -name &lsquo;*.js&rsquo;) - Find all files under the current tree that have the .js extension and print the relative path of each file that matches

Soft links are different. They are more powerful as you can link to other filesystems and to directories but when the original is removed, the link will be broken
(ln -s recipes.txt newrecipes.txt) - Creating a soft link

gzip
    
Used for compressing a file
(gzip filename) - This will compress the file and append the .gz extension to it and the original file is deleted. To prevent this, use the -c option and use the output redirection to write the output to the filename.gz file. ( gzip -c filename &gt; filename.gz)

(alias) - will list all the aliases defined
The alias will work until the terminal sessions is closed
To make it permanent, add it to the shell configuration

tail
    
Opens the file at the end and watches for file changes
Great for watching log files ( tail -f /var/log/system.log )

grep
    
Used to search in lines or can be combined with pipes to filter the output of another command
(grep &ldquo;error&rdquo; logfile.txt) - Finds and prints all lines in logfile.txt containing the word &ldquo;error&rdquo;
(grep &ldquo;hello&rdquo; file1.txt file2.txt) - Searches for &ldquo;hello&rdquo; in both files
You can use -i to ignore case sensitivity
(grep -i &ldquo;error&rdquo; logfile.txt) - Finds &ldquo;Error&rdquo;, &ldquo;error&rdquo; ,etc
Can also be used in searching in the output of another command as shown in the next line
ps aux | grep &ldquo;firefox&rdquo;

echo &ldquo;Today is $(date) - Using echo with other commands

chown
    
Every file/directory in linux has an owner
This command is used to change the owner of the file or directory
The owner of a directory/ file or the root user are eligible to use this command
sudo chown astro test.txt - Transferring the file ownership to astro
chown -R - Changing the ownership of a directory and all other files in it.
chown : - Through this command,I can simulataneousy change the owner and the group of the file
chgrp - Directly changing the group of the file

chmod
    
Used to change the permissions of a file
Every file has 3 permissions (read, write and execute)
For example if a go into a directory and run ls -al, the following is displayed :

After that, the first 3 values eg rwx represents the permissions of the owner of the file/directory
The next 3 values eg r-x represents the permissions of the group of the file
The last 3 values eg &mdash; represents the permissions of the other members or everyone else that comes across the file
rwx means that person has read, write and execute permissions of the file/directory
If either of the rwx values is swapped with - ,that means that person lacks the swapped permission eg :
r-x means the person has read and execute permission but lacks the write permission
You can change the permissions using the chmod command
Changing permissions using numeric notation discussed below :
Each Permission has a numeric value :
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
chmod 755 file.txt - This command sets the owner : rwx (7), Group r-x (5) and others r-x (5)
Changing the permissions using symbolic notation as shown below :
u = Owner
g = Group
o = Others
chmod u&#43;w file.txt - This adds the write permission to the Owner
chmod g-x file.txt - This removes the execute permission from the group
chmod o&#43;r file.txt - This adds the read permission for others

df -h will show the values in human readable format

ps
    
Used to inspect processes that are running on your machine
ps ax - &ldquo;a&rdquo; will list other users&rsquo; processes apart from yours and &ldquo;x&rdquo; will show other processes not linked to any terminal
You can search for a specific process combining grep with a pipe as shown below :
ps ax | grep -i &ldquo;tensorflow&rdquo; | head

pstree
    
Command for displaying processes running on your system in a tree structure

top
    
Used to display dynamic real time information about running processes in your machine

kill
    
Linux processes can receive signals and react to them therefore we can interact with running programs
The kill command is used to terminate a program (kill ). The PID is the process ID
We can use the kill command to send other signals apart from terminating a program as follows :
kill -HUP - hang up - It is sent automatically when a terminal window that started a process is closed before terminating the process
kill -INT - interrupt - It sends the same signal used when we press ctrl - c in the terminal, which usually terminates the process

The PID is the process ID We can use the kill command to send other signals apart from terminating a program as follows :
kill -HUP - hang up - It is sent automatically when a terminal window that started a process is closed before terminating the process
kill -INT - interrupt - It sends the same signal used when we press ctrl - c in the terminal, which usually terminates the process
kill -KILL - This is not sent to the process, but to the operating system which immediately stops but not terminate the process
kill -TERM - terminate - Its the default signal sent by kill
kill -CONT - continue - Used to resume a stopped process
kill -STOP - stop is sent to the operating system kernel which immediately stops but does not terminate the process You might see numbers used instead, like kill -1 . In this case,1 corresponds to HUP. 2 corresponds to INT. 9 corresponds to KILL. 15 corresponds to TERM. 18 corresponds to CONT. 15 corresponds to STOP. type A command can be one of these 4 types :
an executable

  <meta name="twitter:description" content="Date: 2026-01-23 Intro When you type a command in the terminal, your system looks for the executable file in the directories listed in the $PATH variable. If a directory isn’t in $PATH, you must specify the full path to run a script.
Use any of the following options to get more information about linux commands:
man commandName info commandName commandName -h commandName –help env This command will show special variables ls This command is used when listing all the files that are inside a container. It has several combinations such as -al which returns more detailed information about the files inside a particular folder. lsblk This command will show the disks and their partitions info of your pc cat This command is used to show the contents of a file eg
cat /etc/systemd/network.sh cd The change directory command makes it possible for you to move inside a specified path/folder. by using cd .. ,you move to the previous directory/parent folder. pwd This command is used to know which directory you are in, by running it ,it will print the current folder path mkdir This command is used to create folders YOu can create multiple folders with one command: mkdir dogs people You can also create multiple nested folders by adding the -p option: mkdir -p fruits/apples rmdir Used to delete a folder or multiple folders at once ( The folder must be empty) To delete folders with files in them (rm -rf fruits people) mv Used to move a file by specifying the file’s current path and its new path (mv pear new_pear) - Renaming files and folders If the last parameter is a folder, the file located at the first parameter is going to be moved into the folder (mv pear apple fruits) - pear and apple moved to the fruits folder cp Used to copy a file To copy folders, you need to add the -r to recursively copy the whole folder contents (cp -r fruits people) touch Used to create an empty file eg touch apple open Used to open a directory (open .) - opens the current directory Can also be used to open an application find The find command can be used to find files or folders matching a particular search pattern. It searches recursively (find . -name ‘*.js’) - Find all files under the current tree that have the .js extension and print the relative path of each file that matches (find . -type d name src) - Find directories under the current tree matching the name ‘src’ (find folder 1 folder 2 -name filename.txt) - Searching under multiple root trees (find . -type d -name node_modules -or -name public) - Find directories under the current tree matching the name ’node_modules’ or ‘public’ (find . -type d -name ‘.md’ -not -path ’node_modules/’) - excluding a path (find . -type f -size &#43;100c) - Searching files that have more than 100 characters(bytes) in them (find . -type f -size &#43;100k -size -1M) - Searching files bigger tha 100KB but smaller than 1MB (find . -type f -mtime &#43;3) - Searching files edited more that 3 days ago (find . -type f -mtime -1) - Searching files edited in the last 24 hrs ln Used to create links(Pointer to another file) There are two types of links(hard links and soft links Hard links are rarely used.

<li>Every file has 3 permissions (read, write and execute)</li>
<li>For example if a go into a directory and run ls -al, the following is displayed :<br>
drwxrwxr-x 4 astro astro 4096 Feb 9 11:33 .<br>
drwxr-x&mdash; 31 astro astro 4096 Feb 12 14:50 ..<br>
drwxrwxr-x 8 astro astro 4096 Feb 13 12:32 .git<br>
drwxrwxr-x 2 astro astro 4096 Feb 13 12:39 linux-basics<br>
-rw-rw-r&ndash; 1 astro astro 163 Feb 9 11:32 README.md</li>
<li>The letters and hyphens you see at the start of every file/folder are the permissions given of the file/folder</li>
<li>(-) means its a normal file</li>
<li>(d) means its a directory</li>
<li>(l) means its a link</li>
<li>After that, the first 3 values eg rwx represents the permissions of the owner of the file/directory</li>
<li>The next 3 values eg r-x represents the permissions of the group of the file</li>
<li>The last 3 values eg &mdash; represents the permissions of the other members or everyone else that comes across the file</li>
<li>rwx means that person has read, write and execute permissions of the file/directory</li>
<li>If either of the rwx values is swapped with - ,that means that person lacks the swapped permission eg :</li>
<li>r-x means the person has read and execute permission but lacks the write permission</li>
<li>You can change the permissions using the chmod command</li>
<li>Changing permissions using numeric notation discussed below :<br>
Each Permission has a numeric value :<br>
r = 4<br>
w = 2<br>
x = 1</li>
<li>chmod 755 file.txt - This command sets the owner : rwx (7), Group r-x (5) and others r-x (5)</li>
<li>Changing the permissions using symbolic notation as shown below :<br>
u = Owner<br>
g = Group<br>
o = Others</li>
<li>chmod u+w file.txt - This adds the write permission to the Owner</li>
<li>chmod g-x file.txt - This removes the execute permission from the group</li>
<li>chmod o+r file.txt - This adds the read permission for others</li>

    <a href="#kill" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"></a></h2><ul>
<li>Linux processes can receive signals and react to them therefore we can interact with running programs</li>
<li>The kill command is used to terminate a program (kill ). The PID is the process ID</li>
<li>We can use the kill command to send other signals apart from terminating a program as follows :<br>
kill -HUP - hang up - It is sent automatically when a terminal window that started a process is closed before terminating the process<br>
kill -INT - interrupt - It sends the same signal used when we press ctrl - c in the terminal, which usually terminates the process<br>
kill -KILL - This is not sent to the process, but to the operating system which immediately stops but not terminate the process<br>
kill -TERM - terminate - Its the default signal sent by kill<br>
kill -CONT - continue - Used to resume a stopped process<br>
kill -STOP - stop is sent to the operating system kernel which immediately stops but does not terminate the process</li>
<li>You might see numbers used instead, like kill -1 . In this case,1 corresponds to HUP. 2 corresponds to INT. 9 corresponds to KILL. 15 corresponds to TERM. 18 corresponds to CONT. 15 corresponds to STOP.</li>
